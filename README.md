# Auto_ParkMaster_IOT

Iâ€™m proud to share my final semester project "Auto ParkMaster", an IoT-based smart parking system developed as part of my MSc IT program. This project focuses on automating and optimizing the vehicle parking experience using real-time monitoring and control systems. In this project, I have used IR sensors, LDR sensor, Arduino UNO, and various other IoT components to design and build a fully functional smart parking prototype.

Key Features:

   Fully Automated Entry & Exit
   Real-Time Parking Slot Updates
   Low-Light LED Activation
   Scalable to More Parking Slots
   Cost-Effective and Energy Efficient


Working of Project:

    over-project definition is an auto park master which is based on a smart parking system. In the over parking system there  are 4 available slots for the car park . When the car is coming towards the parking system there is a LCD screen which shows the availability of slots and also shows which slot is empty or not . The car is enter first ir sensor is sens the car and the baroiur can be opened after that the second ir sensor sens the car and the baroiur can be closed . As The diver has information about availability of slots so he can park as per that. same as when 2nd car is enter lcd screen show that 2nd 3rd and 4th slot is empty and 1st is full so 2nd car can be parked in 2nd 3rd or 4th slot.
When the third car enters, on the lcd screen availability of slots are 3rd and 4th so the driver can park as per detail. when 4th car is enter
Only 1 slot is available so the driver can be parked in 4th slot. now parking is full . when the 5th car is enter lcd shows that parking is full ,no empty slot. and the barrier cannot open . When any of car is coming towards the exit gate there is ir sensor which sense car and the baroiur can be opened after that the second ir sensor sens the car and the baroiur can be closed and also the lcd screen is showing that perticular slot is empty and other slots are full. This process is the same as for other slots car exits and the lcd screen is showing the real time update of slots. We also add the light functionality on the project. In the parking area detecting darkness or low-light conditions that time automatically turns ON white LED lights when there is not enough sunlight. white LED lights automatically turns off when there is enough sunlight.
