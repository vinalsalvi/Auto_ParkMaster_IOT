# Auto_ParkMaster_IOT

Iâ€™m proud to share my final semester project "Auto ParkMaster", an IoT-based smart parking system developed as part of my MSc IT program. This project focuses on automating and optimizing the vehicle parking experience using real-time monitoring and control systems. In this project, I have used IR sensors, LDR sensor, Arduino UNO, and various other IoT components to design and build a fully functional smart parking prototype.
